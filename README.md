# DEVSECOPS

DevSecOps combines "Development," "Security," and "Operations."
It integrates security practices and principles into every phase of the software development lifecycle.
DevSecOps emphasizes a shift-left approach, where security is addressed early on, from planning to deployment and maintenance.
